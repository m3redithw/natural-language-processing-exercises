# About NLP
## Use Cases
**Voice of Customer Analytics:** Improve products and services through analysis of customer interactions, such as support emails, social media posts, online comments, telephone transcriptions, i.e., to discover what factors drive the most positive and negative experiences. An example would be to extract key phrases and topics by summarizing blocks of text from open-ended survey responses in order to extract the most important and central ideas that can lead to actionable insights.

**Semantic Search:** Provide a better search experience by enabling your search engine to index key phrases, entities, and sentiment. This enables you to focus the search on the intent and the context of the articles instead of basic keywords.

**Knowledge Management & Discovery:** Organize and categorize your documents by topic for easier discovery. You might want to personalize content recommendations for readers by recommending other articles related to the same topic. Or you might want to ensure the security of documents by closely monitoring those documents containing sensitive materials (Topic Modeling).
